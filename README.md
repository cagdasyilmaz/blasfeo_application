Welcome to the blasfeo_application wiki!

In this repository, examples of BLASFEO (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines for Embedded Optimization) matrix library are implemented. This dense linear algebra library (DLA) aims at providing  high-performance implementations of
BLAS- and LAPACK-like routines for use in embedded optimization.

_Basic Build Instructions_ (on Linux operating system)
1. Make a build directory: **make build**
2. Run it: **./getting_started.out**

_Basic Clean Instructions_ (on Linux operating system)
1. Clean the directory: **make deep_clean**
