# blasfeo_application

Welcome to the blasfeo_application wiki!

In this repository, examples of BLASFEO (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines for Embedded Optimization) matrix library are implemented. This dense linear algebra library (DLA) aims at providing  high-performance implementations of
BLAS- and LAPACK-like routines for use in embedded optimization.
